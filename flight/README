API for a Flight Booking Service

Currently assumes the database is running at http://admin:password@localhost:5984
Ensure you have the couchdb image running at port 5984.

Implemented features are:
Flights!
- GET /flights to get all flights (but it only gives you the ids)
- GET /flights/[id] to get the flight with database id '[id]'
- GET /flights?param=value to get flights according to the params you supply,
    which can be:
    - one of {flight_num, origin, dest, departure, arrival} : to filter for
      flights that have values matching what you supply
    - limit : to limit the number of flights you get (default is 25)
    - skip : to skip a number of flights (default is 0), best used in
      conjunction with limit
Note that you can use multiple params,
e.g. GET /flights?dest=China&limit=100&skip=10 and so on

Bookings - note that all transformative operations are idempotent!
In order to book a flight you must first acquire an id:
- GET /booking/id gives you an unused id to use when creating a booking
Once you have an id, you can create a booking:
- PUT /booking/[id] with the body of the request containing a JSON object with
  fields:
    - user - name of the user who is booking the flight
    - flight - id of the flight being booked
  If successful, the JSON body of the response will contain {ok: true}. If the
  flight is booked already, ok will be false. 400 and 404 errors can occur.
You can cancel a booking:
- DELETE /booking/[id]
