API for a Flight Booking Service

Currently assumes the database is running at http://admin:password@localhost:5984
Ensure you have the couchdb image running at port 5984.

Implemented features are:
- GET /flights to get all flights (but it only gives you the ids)
- GET /flights/id to get the flight with database id 'id'
- GET /flights?param=value to get flights according to the params you supply, which can be:
    - one of {flight_num, origin, dest, departure, arrival} : to filter for flights that have values matching what you supply
    - limit : to limit the number of flights you get (default is 25)
    - skip : to skip a number of flights (default is 0), best used in conjunction with limit
    Note that you can use multiple params, e.g. GET /flights?dest=China&limit=100&skip=10 and so on
